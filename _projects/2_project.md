# Description

Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) is a new type of seismic monitoring
technique that uses fibre optic cables buried in the ground to measure
vibrations in the Earth at a much finer scale than traditional
seismometers. The introduction of DAS techniques has opened up a range
of non-traditional passive monitoring applications owing to the
increased sensitivity of the method. Examples include, monitoring the
density of road traffic that could be used by emergency services,
detecting, and localizing changes in subsurface hydrology, as well as
the more traditional seismic tomography and earthquake detection
applications.

To assist in the design of modern DAS deployments, much is still not
known about the sensitivities of different geometries (e.g., star
pattern, spiral etc) of DAS installations or what would be optimal
given some target application.  The aim of this project is threefold:
firstly, to develop the tools to rapidly estimate the sensitivity of a
given DAS geometry to a surface source of seismic noise using Machine
Learning techniques such as Physically Informed Neural Networks
(PINNs) based on existing numerical codes. Secondly, to trial a number
of different candidate geometries at a realistic scale. Lastly, to
demonstrate the feasibility or otherwise of using certain DAS
configurations for applications such as traffic monitoring, detecting
hydrological movement, and detecting small earthquakes not generally
detectable with traditional seismometers.

This is a joint project between the School of Computing and the
Research School of Earth Sciences (RSES). The researchers from RSES
can provide 1D and 2D numerical waveform simulation codes, suitable
test problems, and real data for the advanced student who wants to
demonstrate their work beyond synthetic test problems.

# Pre-requisites

Machine learning experience would be desirable.

Although not mandatory, some mathematical knowledge or numerical modelling knowledge would be desirable.

Use of HPC resources (e.g., Gadi) would be advantageous

# Notes

This project would be suitable for a 12 pt or 24 pt student
