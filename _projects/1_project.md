# Description

The dynamics of the Earth's mantle is the primary driver of a number
physical phenomena on the Earth's surface that directly impact our
society. Examples include the impact on dynamic topography which has
long term consequences for understanding future sea-level change scenarios, the impact on past
intra-plate volcanism which can have important implication for the
location of economically important minerals, and lastly is the key
driver of global tectonic plate movement which at subduction zones
causes the most damaging Earthquakes.

One of the key methods of understanding the dynamics of the Earth's
mantle is large scale geodynamical simulations. These 3D codes use
large amounts of computing resources to model the time evolution of
the Stoke's equation (the evolution of the temperature, velocity and
pressure).  At the smaller computational scales, we can use simpler 2D
simulations for idealised studies, or semi-analytical solutions that ignore
the rheological complexities within the Earth.

The aim of this project is to investigate the use of Machine Learning
techniques to the Stoke's equation used in simulations of the Earth's
mantle in 2 dimensions. The original Physically Informed Neural
Networks (PINNs) paper applied machine learning to a fluid flow
problem which is closely related to the phyiscal equations used for
mantle dynamics. There has also been recent work on the use of Auto
Encoders for implementing numerical time integrators for physical
problems that can be more efficient than traditional hand coded
numerical solvers.  More recent examples of Auto Encoders have the
ability to simulate forwards and backwards in time which can be of
benefit when back tracking the Earths current state back in time.

This is a joint project between the School of Computing and the
Research School of Earth Sciences (RSES). The researchers from RSES
can provide 1D and 2D codes, suitable test problems, and guidance for
the project.

# Pre-requisites

Machine learning experience would be desirable.

This project involves modelling geodynamical flows, so some degree of
maths background would be helpful but is not mandatory.

Use of HPC resources (e.g. Gadi) would be advantageous

# Notes

This project would be suitable for a 12 pt or 24 pt student
