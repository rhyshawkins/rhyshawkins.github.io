# Description

One of the key methods we have for understanding the composition and
structure of the deep Earth is through seismic tomography. A
relatively recent advance in the field of seismic tomography is the
use of full waveform simulation and adjoint techniques to iteratively
refine models of the Earth in an optimization framework. More recent
work has incorporated a Variational Bayes to estimating both likely
structure of the smaller regions of the Earth and their associated
uncertainties.

A key part of this inference is in the formulation of a penalty function
between simulated and observed waveforms. There are many different
approaches to formulating this misfit

The first aim of this project is to investigate the use of Variational Bayes
techniques and Gaussian Process models to formulate an adjoint waveform
tomography problem. This consists of two separate parts:

- Firstly, formulating of an adjoint source in a probabilistic sense
- Secondly, the implications of the choice of penalty function (probability) has
on our understanding of the resulting model of the Earth (or part thereof), i.e. the
uncertainties of the Earth model

# Pre-requisites

Experience or knowledge of topics such as Bayesian Inference,
Variational Bayes, Gaussian Processes, and associated
Optimization/Machine Learning techniques would be desirable.

Experiences in the use of HPC resources (e.g. Gadi) would be advantageous.

# Notes

This project would be suitable for a 12pt or 24pt Honors Student
