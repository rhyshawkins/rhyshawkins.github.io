I convene and lecture half of the course "High Performance Scientific
Computing". This course was a personal favorite of mine as an
undergraduate, taught at the time by Henry Gardner and Alistair
Rendell. The lessons I learnt from taking this course many years ago
still underpins much of my current research, and it is a pleasure to
teach it. The course is an important one that any aspiring
"Computational Scientist" should strongly consider taking.
