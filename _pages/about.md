After completing undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and
Engineering, and a MPhil in Computer Science, I worked for more than
a decade as a research programmer with positions at the ANU School of
Computing, CSIRO, and NCI (Australia’s peak
supercomputing facility).


During my time at NCI, I developed an interest in the Earth
sciences which lead to me completing a PhD in Geophysics in 2018.

I combine high performance computing, applied mathematics, Bayesian
inference and machine learning techniques to robustly determine the
structure and composition of the Earth at various scales.

I am particularly interested in promoting student projects and broader
collaborations that bring new and developing computer science
techniques that enable new applications and discoveries within the
Earth Sciences. See my proposed student projects which showcase some
of these ideas.
